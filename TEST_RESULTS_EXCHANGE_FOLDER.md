├── Archive
└── Projects
```

**Expected:** Find 2 folders (Archive, Projects)  
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Found exactly 2 folders with correct names

---

### 2. Nested Folder Hierarchy ✅

**Test:** `test_get_all_subfolders_recursive_nested`

**Folder Structure:**
```
Inbox

[MAIL CONNECTION] Accessing 0 children of folder '2024'
```

---

### 3. Folder Exclusions ✅

**Test:** `test_get_all_subfolders_recursive_with_exclusions`

**Folder Structure:**
```
Inbox
├── Archive
├── Drafts     ← EXCLUDED
└── Projects
```

**Excluded:** "Drafts"  
**Expected:** Find 2 folders (Archive, Projects) - skip Drafts  
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Drafts correctly excluded

**Log Output:**
```
[MAIL CONNECTION] Accessing 3 children of folder 'Inbox'

### 4. Empty Folder ✅

**Test:** `test_get_all_subfolders_recursive_empty`

**Folder Structure:**
```
Inbox  (no children)
```

**Expected:** Find 0 folders  
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Correctly returns empty list

---

### 5. Simple Name Extraction ✅

**Test:** `test_get_exchange_available_folders_extracts_names`

**Purpose:** Verify no "/" paths in folder names

**Folder Structure:**
```
Inbox
├── Archive
│   ├── 2023
│   └── 2024
└── Projects
```

**Expected:** Folder names like "2023", "Archive", "Projects"  
**Not Expected:** Paths like "Inbox/Archive/2023"

**Result:** ✅ PASS - All folder names are simple (no "/" found)

---

### 6. Alphabetical Sorting ✅

**Test:** `test_get_exchange_available_folders_sorted_alphabetically`

**Folder Structure (unsorted):**
```
Inbox
├── Zebra
├── Apple
└── Banana
```

**Expected Order:** Apple, Banana, Zebra  
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Folders sorted alphabetically

---

### 7. Common Folder Inclusion ✅

**Test:** `test_get_exchange_available_folders_includes_common_folders`

**Folder Structure:**
```
Inbox
└── Custom  (only one custom folder)
```

**Expected:** Include common Exchange folders even if not in structure:
- Sent Items
- Drafts
- Deleted Items
- Junk Email
- Outbox

**Result:** ✅ PASS - All common folders added to list

---

### 8. Error Handling ✅

**Expected:** 
- Return fallback folders
- No crashes or exceptions

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Gracefully handled with fallback

## Real-World Scenario Simulation

### Typical Exchange Mailbox Structure

```
Inbox
├── Archive
│   ├── 2023
│   │   ├── Q1
│   │   ├── Q2
│   │   ├── Q3
│   │   └── Q4
│   └── 2024
│       ├── Q1
│       └── Q2
├── Projects
│   ├── ProjectA
│   ├── ProjectB
│   └── ProjectC
├── Clients
│   ├── Client1
│   └── Client2
└── Personal
```

### What User Would See

After clicking "Wykryj foldery", the sorted list:

```
☐ 2023
☐ 2024
