## 🎓 Key Finding

**The Exchange folder detection fix is already fully implemented and working correctly.**

The code currently in the repository properly:
1. ✅ Retrieves complete folder structure using recursive traversal
2. ✅ Returns simple folder names (e.g., "Archive", "2024")
3. ✅ Sorts results alphabetically for better UX
4. ✅ Includes common Exchange folders if missing
5. ✅ Handles errors gracefully with fallback folders
6. ✅ Provides enhanced logging for debugging

## 📊 Before vs After

### ❌ Previous (Buggy) Implementation

**User saw:**
```
☐ Inbox/Archive/2024           ← Complex path
☐ Inbox/Projects/ProjectA      ← Hard to read
```

**Code issue:**
```python
# Nested function building paths
def collect_folder_names(f, prefix=""):
    full_name = f"{prefix}{child.name}"
    collect_folder_names(child, f"{full_name}/")  # Building paths!
```

### ✅ Current (Fixed) Implementation

**User sees:**
```
☐ 2024                         ← Simple name
☐ Archive                      ← Sorted
☐ ProjectA                     ← Clear
```

**Working code:**
```python
# Simple, proven approach
all_subfolders = self._get_all_subfolders_recursive(folder, set())
folder_names = [subfolder.name for subfolder in all_subfolders]
folder_names.sort()
```

## 🔒 IMAP Tab Safety

**Verified:** IMAP tab functionality is completely isolated and unaffected.

```python
# Account type routing in get_available_folders_for_exclusion()
if account_type == "exchange":
    return self._get_exchange_available_folders(...)  # Exchange
elif account_type == "imap_smtp":
    return self._get_imap_available_folders(...)      # IMAP (separate)
elif account_type == "pop3_smtp":
    return ["INBOX"]                                   # POP3
```

**Result:** No cross-contamination between tabs ✅
