```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Open Exchange Mail Tab
1. Launch the application
2. Go to **"Poczta Exchange"** tab
3. Go to **"Wyszukiwanie"** (Search) section

### Step 2: Click "Wykryj foldery"
1. Locate the **"Wykryj foldery"** button
2. Click it
3. Wait for folder discovery to complete (a few seconds)

### Step 3: Verify Complete List
✅ You should see:
- **System folders** (Sent Items, Drafts, Deleted Items, Junk Email, Outbox)
- **Inbox** and its subfolders
- **Root-level user folders** (if any)
- **All nested folders**

✅ Folder count should be **higher** than before

✅ All folders should be available for selection/exclusion

### Step 4: Check IMAP Tab (Should Be Unchanged)
1. Go to **"Poczta IMAP"** tab
2. Test folder detection there
3. ✅ IMAP should work exactly as before (not affected)

## FAQ

### Q: Will this affect my existing folder selections?
**A:** No. Your saved folder selections in config files are preserved.

### Q: Will IMAP be affected?
**A:** No. IMAP uses completely separate code and is not affected.

### Q: What if I have custom folders at root level?
**A:** They will now be visible! Before the fix, they were hidden if they were not inside Inbox.

### Q: Will the fix slow down folder discovery?
**A:** No. Discovery time should be the same or slightly faster since it uses a more direct approach.

### Q: What if root folder access fails?
**A:** The code has fallback strategies:
1. Try `account.root` (primary)
2. Try `account.inbox.parent` (fallback 1)
3. Try specified folder path (fallback 2)
4. Return standard folders (fallback 3)

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ Complete folder visibility
- ✅ Can exclude any folder from search
- ✅ Better control over search scope
- ✅ Matches actual Exchange structure
- ✅ No hidden folders

### For Administrators
- ✅ Easier troubleshooting
- ✅ Better logs for debugging
- ✅ Robust fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Matches Exchange best practices

---

## Technical Notes

### Why Was This Missing?
The old code started folder discovery from the specified folder path (usually "Inbox"), which only traversed **subfolders**. It didn't access folders at the **same level** as Inbox (siblings).

### How Was It Fixed?
Changed to start from `account.root`, which is the top-level folder in Exchange (often called "Top of Information Store"). This gives access to **all folders** in the mailbox.

### What About Performance?
No negative impact. The recursive traversal algorithm is the same, just starting from a different (higher) point in the tree.

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Version:** January 2025
