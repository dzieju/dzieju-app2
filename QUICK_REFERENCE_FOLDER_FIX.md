## 📋 Quick Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|

## 🔍 What Was Missing?

**System folders** that are siblings of Inbox (not children):
- ❌ Sent Items (Wysłane)
- ❌ Drafts (Szkice)
- ❌ Deleted Items (Kosz)
- ❌ Junk Email (Spam)
- ❌ Outbox (Skrzynka nadawcza)

**Now all visible!** ✅

## 💡 Why?

Exchange folder structure:
```
Root
├── Inbox           ← OLD: Started here
│   └── Archive     ✓ Was visible
├── Sent Items      ✗ Was missing (not under Inbox!)
├── Drafts          ✗ Was missing
└── ...             ✗ All missing
```

New approach:
```
Root                ← NEW: Start here!
├── Inbox           ✓ Now all visible
├── Sent Items      ✓
├── Drafts          ✓
└── ...             ✓
```

## 🧪 How to Test?

1. Open **Poczta Exchange** tab
2. Click **"Wykryj foldery"**
3. ✅ Should see **12+ folders** (was ~6)
4. ✅ Should see **Sent Items, Drafts, etc.**

## 📁 Files Changed

1. `gui/exchange_search_components/mail_connection.py`
2. `gui/mail_search_components/mail_connection.py`

- New: `root_folder = account.root`

---

## ✅ Safety
